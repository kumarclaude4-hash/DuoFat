/**
 * Capability-based device performance tier.
 *
 * <p>This replaces the old {@code Build.SUPPORTED_64_BIT_ABIS} check that used to drive video
 * capture resolution, bitrate policy and the thermal watchdog. That check was wrong: it assumed
 * "64-bit == fast", so an arm64 budget SoC such as the MediaTek Helio P35 (MT6765, 8x Cortex-A53
 * @ 2.2/1.6 GHz, PowerVR GE8320) was treated as a flagship and handed 720p30 capture with
 * unbounded bitrate and no thermal protection.
 *
 * <p>The decisive signal here is CPU <em>microarchitecture</em>, not core count or clock speed.
 * Cortex-A53/A55-class cores are in-order designs: 8x A53 @ 2.2 GHz has a small fraction of the
 * per-clock throughput of any out-of-order core, so MHz and core count are actively misleading.
 * If every core in the system is an in-order "little" core, the device is {@link #LOW} no matter
 * how many of them there are or how high they clock.
 *
 * <p>Resolution is performed once and cached. All probing is a handful of small sysfs/procfs
 * reads done lazily on first call, never on a hot path.
