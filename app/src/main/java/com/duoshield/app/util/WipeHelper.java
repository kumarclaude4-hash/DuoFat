/**
 * Canonical local-data erasure for every wipe path in the app.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this class is the single source of truth.</strong> The app previously had
 * three independently-written erasure routines — voluntary "Wipe &amp; Exit"
 * ({@link #wipeAll}), "Unpair Device" (DangerZoneSettingsActivity), and the duress-PIN
 * logout (DuressManager). They drifted apart over time, and the drift was silent because
 * nothing compared them. The most security-critical path (duress) had become the
 * <em>weakest</em> of the three: it left the decrypted-media disk cache
 * ({@code filesDir/b2_cache}) and the temp/export cache directory intact, so a forensic
 * extraction after a duress wipe still recovered readable photos and videos — data that
 * needs no key to read, making the surviving key-destruction irrelevant for it. Unpair
 * was leaking the same media cache plus gallery-saved media, and was leaving the Firebase
 * session signed in.
 *
 * <p>All three paths now funnel through {@link #eraseLocalData}, so a step added for one
 * path is automatically applied to the others. <strong>Do not add erasure steps directly
 * to a caller.</strong> Add them here, and gate them on {@link WipeMode} only when a mode
 * genuinely must differ (the differences are enumerated on {@link WipeMode}).
