/**
 * One-time rescue of secrets written by the old plaintext {@code MODE_PRIVATE}
 * fallback in {@link SecurePrefs} (S08-H5).
 *
 * <h3>Why a migrator is required rather than just deleting the fallback</h3>
 * Removing the plaintext fallback is the fix, but it cannot be done in
 * isolation. Installs that already ran on a device where all Keystore tiers
 * failed have their real secrets sitting in a plaintext XML file — including
 * the SQLCipher passphrase. If the new build simply stopped looking there,
 * {@code DatabaseKeyProvider} would find no key, see an existing database, and
 * throw {@code KeyUnavailableException} forever: the user's entire message
 * history would become permanently unreadable. So the fallback's removal and
 * this migration have to ship together.
 *
 * <h3>The file-sharing problem this has to work around</h3>
 * The old fallback used the <em>same file name</em> as
 * {@code EncryptedSharedPreferences} (ESP), so a device that failed init once
 * and succeeded later has both plaintext entries and ESP entries interleaved in
 * one XML file. ESP cannot see the plaintext ones: it encrypts key names before
 * looking them up, so {@code getString("db_cipher_key_v1")} searches for a
 * Base64 SIV blob and misses the literal key entirely. The two sets therefore
 * have to be told apart by inspecting the raw file.
 *
 * <p>The discriminator is {@link #looksLikeEspEntry}: ESP key names are Base64
 * of a 16-byte-or-larger SIV output, so anything that is not decodable Base64 of
 * sufficient length is a legacy plaintext key. This is a heuristic, and it is
 * worth being precise about which way it can fail:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>A plaintext key mistaken for an ESP key</b> (possible only if an
 *       app-chosen key name happens to be valid Base64 of ≥16 bytes) would be
 *       skipped, leaving that one secret unmigrated. No data is destroyed —
 *       the plaintext file is only cleared after a verified read-back, and only
 *       for entries that were actually migrated.</li>
 *   <li><b>An ESP key mistaken for a plaintext key</b> would copy a ciphertext
 *       string into the encrypted store under a junk name. Harmless clutter; it
 *       shadows nothing, because real lookups go through encrypted key names.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Neither direction can lose data, which is the property that matters here.
