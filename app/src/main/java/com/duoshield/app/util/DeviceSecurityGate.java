/**
 * Single decision point for "may this device create or restore an account?" (S08-H5).
 *
 * <h3>Why this class exists</h3>
 * {@link SecurePrefs} no longer has a plaintext fallback. When every Keystore tier
 * fails it hands out an in-memory {@link EphemeralSharedPreferences}, which means
 * nothing survives process death — not the SQLCipher passphrase, not the Signal
 * identity key, not the PIN hash. Letting a user onboard or restore on such a
 * device would produce an account that silently evaporates on the next cold start,
 * and (worse) a database whose passphrase is gone while the database file remains,
 * which {@link com.duoshield.app.db.DatabaseKeyProvider} must then refuse to open.
 *
 * <p>Centralising the check here rather than repeating it at each entry point is
 * deliberate: the failure mode of a duplicated policy is one copy drifting, and the
 * drifted copy is the one that lets a user create unrecoverable data.
 *
 * <h3>What this deliberately does NOT block</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@link SecurePrefs.SecurityTier#SOFTWARE}.</b> Still AES-256-GCM
 *       encrypted and still Keystore-protected; it is durable, so an account
 *       created on it works correctly. Blocking it would lock out the exact
 *       budget-device population (Helio G36, Android Go) that tier 2 was added
 *       to support. It is a weaker tier, not a broken one.</li>
 *   <li><b>Existing installs.</b> Only entry points that would create <em>new</em>
 *       durable state consult this gate. An existing install that has already
 *       written its keys must keep opening — see {@link LegacyPlaintextMigrator}.
 *       Blocking sign-in on a transient Keystore failure would be a self-inflicted
 *       denial of service on a user's own message history.</li>
 * </ul>
