/**
 * Stores the app PIN hash in EncryptedSharedPreferences (SecurePrefs), scoped
 * to the currently signed-in Firebase UID.
 *
 * <h3>Why UID-scoped?</h3>
 * The duress logout intentionally preserves the PIN hash so a restore attempt
 * is still gated. But if a NEW user signs in on the same device after a duress
 * wipe they must not see a lock screen for a PIN they never set — that would be
 * suspicious. Keying by UID means each account has its own hash entry and a new
 * account starts with no hash → no lock screen.
 *
 * <h3>Migration</h3>
 * Existing installs that stored the hash under the legacy global key
 * {@code "app_pin_hash"} are migrated transparently on first access: the value
 * is moved to the UID-scoped key and the legacy entry is removed.
 *
 * <h3>Device-scoped gate PIN storage</h3>
 * The device-level gate PIN (see below) lives in its own SecurePrefs file
 * ({@link SecurePrefs#getDeviceGate}) — a physically separate container from
 * the account-scoped file this class otherwise uses. That split is load-
 * bearing: {@code DuressManager.performLogout()}, {@code WipeHelper.wipeAll()},
 * and the Danger Zone "unpair" flow all blank-clear() the account-scoped file
 * when wiping an account from this device, and the device gate must survive
 * every one of those wipes — it protects the device itself, not any one
 * account. Installs that set a device PIN before the split are migrated
 * transparently on first read, mirroring the legacy-key pattern above.
