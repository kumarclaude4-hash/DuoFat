/**
 * Periodic WorkManager job that deletes expired messages from both the local
 * Room database and the Firestore conversation sub-collection.
 *
 * <p>Deletion is driven by per-message expiry: {@code message.expiresAt} — an absolute
 * epoch-millisecond deadline written at send time by
 * {@code ChatMediaActivity.sendMessage()} and {@code MessageBuilder}.
 * A value of {@code 0} means "never expire".
 *
 * <p>Runs every 15 minutes while any conversation has disappearing messages enabled
 * (scheduled by {@link com.duoshield.app.util.SelfDestructScheduler}).
 *
 * <p>F43 fix: A legacy global-TTL mechanism has been removed. It was dead code
 * whose controlling preference was never written by any live UI path, and it posed
 * a risk of silently deleting messages that should not have been deleted.
