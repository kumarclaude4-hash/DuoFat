/**
 * Manages the SQLCipher full-database encryption passphrase (BUG-D01).
 *
 * <p>A random 32-byte key is generated on first launch and stored in
 * EncryptedSharedPreferences so it survives app restarts but is protected
 * by the Android Keystore.
 *
 * <h3>Durability contract (SEC-D02)</h3>
 * The passphrase is the <em>only</em> thing standing between the user and
 * total loss of their message history: {@link AppDatabase} deletes and
 * recreates the database whenever SQLCipher cannot open it. Two failure
 * modes previously caused silent, unrecoverable data loss:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Non-durable write.</b> The key was persisted with
 *       {@code apply()}, which returns before the value reaches disk. If the
 *       process was killed between "database created" and "key flushed",
 *       the next launch found no key, minted a different one, failed to
 *       open the database, and wiped it. Now persisted with
 *       {@code commit()} and read back before the key is returned, so the
 *       key is guaranteed on disk before any database file exists.</li>
 *   <li><b>Temporarily unreadable key.</b> {@link SecurePrefs}'s tier-3
 *       recovery path deletes the master-key alias, which makes previously
 *       stored ciphertext unreadable. (It used to also fall back to a
 *       plaintext store; that tier no longer exists — see
 *       {@link SecurePrefs.SecurityTier}.) The old code treated "cannot read key" as
 *       "first run" and minted a fresh key, which guaranteed the database
 *       got destroyed even though the data was still intact and would have
 *       been readable on a later boot when Keystore recovered. Now we only
 *       mint a new key when there is no database to lose; otherwise we
 *       raise {@link KeyUnavailableException} so the caller can retry
 *       instead of destroying data.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Callers must zero the returned array after passing it to
 * {@link net.sqlcipher.database.SupportFactory}.
