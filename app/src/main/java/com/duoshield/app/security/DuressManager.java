     * {@code isDuressPin()} used to return early when no secondary hash was stored,

     * unlock attempt while an account without ran one. At 310,000 iterations that is

     * long, on every unlock and every wrong guess, with {@code DevicePinGateActivity}
     * conveniently providing a one-derivation baseline to compare against. No tooling
     * was required to detect it. That leak defeated the hidden UI row, the
     * server-side enrollment gate, and every other measure taken to keep the
     * capability undiscoverable.
     *
     * <p>Both halves matter and both are handled here: the <em>work</em> is now
     * constant (always exactly one derivation against slot B) and the <em>stored
     * shape</em> is constant (every account has a slot B of identical form, so its
     * presence discloses nothing). The decoy is 32 random bytes, so no PIN can ever
     * match it.
     *
     * <p>Called from {@code PinManager.setPin} so enrolled and non-enrolled accounts
     * are indistinguishable from the moment a PIN first exists.
     *
     * <p><strong>Residual risk, stated honestly:</strong> {@code pin_slot_b_armed_*}
     * still distinguishes a real secondary code from a decoy to anyone who can read
     * SecurePrefs itself (root on an unlocked device). Removing that last bit would
     * require deriving armed-ness from the entered PIN, which is a substantially
     * larger change. What this closes is the <em>remote/observational</em> leak that
     * needed nothing but a wall clock.
