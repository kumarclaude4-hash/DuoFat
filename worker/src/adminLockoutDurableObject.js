// ── AdminLockoutCounter: atomic admin brute-force lockout counter ───────────
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (follow-up to the 2026-08-14 Upstash → Cloudflare KV
// migration; see server/lib/adminLockoutStore.js's "MIGRATION" note and
// BUG_TRACKER.md's S04-L3 row for the full history)
//
// The first Cloudflare KV version of this counter used a plain
// GET → increment → PUT against KV's REST API, which has no INCR/CAS
// equivalent. That was flagged as a real race — not a theoretical one:
// concurrent failed admin-login requests can each read the same
// pre-increment count and each write count+1, so the lockout counter
// UNDERCOUNTS under concurrency. For a brute-force gate specifically, that
// is not an acceptable tradeoff to wave away by analogy to this repo's other
// (non-security) best-effort KV counters — it needs an actual fix, not a
// bigger comment.
//
// THE FIX: a Durable Object.
//
// Cloudflare Durable Objects guarantee that all requests routed to the SAME
// object instance are processed one at a time — the runtime's input/output
// gating means a `fetch()` handler's storage reads and writes cannot
// interleave with another concurrent `fetch()` call to that same instance,
// with no manual locking required. (See Cloudflare's Durable Objects docs:
// "Requests to the same Durable Object are delivered in order and processed
// one at a time.") Every (normalized IP)'s lockout state lives in exactly
// one Durable Object instance (`idFromName(key)`), so incrementing that
// instance's counter is a true atomic operation: two concurrent failures
// for the same IP are guaranteed to be applied as two increments, never
// collapsed into one.
//
// This is available on the Cloudflare Workers FREE plan as of the SQLite
// storage backend (`new_sqlite_classes` migration in wrangler.jsonc) — no
// paid plan is required, contrary to this repo's older assumption (see the
// superseded comment this replaces in adminLockoutStore.js and the Worker's
// S03-I2 "no Durable Objects" note, which predates this fix and no longer
// applies to this one counter).
//
// SCOPE: this Durable Object exists ONLY for the admin lockout counter. It
// does not replace or generalize to the Worker's other KV-backed counters
// (rate limiting, storage quotas) — those remain best-effort KV as before,
// because their failure mode (an approximate quota/rate limit) does not
// carry the same "brute-force gate must not undercount" requirement that
// motivated this specific fix.
//
// WHAT IS STORED: `{ count, windowStart }` only, in this instance's own
// transactional storage (`state.storage`, SQLite-backed) — no tokens,
// secrets, or PII. Structurally identical to the record shape the KV
// version stored, but see the API surface: this Durable Object is called
// with a single atomic RPC per admin lockout operation (`record` /
// `status` / `reset`), not raw get/put/delete, precisely because the
// atomicity guarantee lives in "one instance processes one request fully
// before starting the next", not in any single storage call.
//
// AUTHENTICATION: this class has no fetch handler of its own reachable from
// the public Internet — Durable Object instances are only reachable via a
// binding from within this same Worker (`env.ADMIN_LOCKOUT_DO`), never
// exposed on a public route directly. The Worker's own `/adminLockout` route
// (see index.js) is what's Internet-reachable, and that route enforces
// `ADMIN_LOCKOUT_SECRET` (same fail-closed, timing-safe pattern as
// `STATS_SECRET`) before ever touching this class. This module therefore
// does not re-check auth — by the time a request reaches here, the Worker
// has already authorized it.

    // outbound fetch) between the read and the write would reopen exactly
    // the race this class exists to close, because the runtime only
    // guarantees no other REQUEST's JS interleaves — it does not turn
    // unrelated async gaps within a single request into a lock across
    // requests by itself. Keep it this way: read storage, compute, write
    // storage, return — nothing else in between.
