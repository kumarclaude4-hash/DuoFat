# SESSION S3-15 — App Check + client provider wiring

Lane: AND/RULES (verify BLOCKED → S3-15b/S3-19b). Finding: `S10-N1`.

## 0. Start-of-session verification (protocol §3)

Read `BUG_TRACKER.md`'s `S10-N1` row: `Open`/`Carried`, description "Firebase App Check absent."
Falsification check before touching anything:

```
grep -rni "appcheck\|app-check\|app check\|play.integrity\|playintegrity" \
  --include=*.gradle --include=*.java --include=*.kt --include=*.rules --include=*.xml -l .
```

→ **zero matches** (excluding this session's own future edits). Confirms the tracker's `Open`
disposition was accurate — nothing had been done yet. `git status --short` was clean; `git log -3`
showed S3-14's close-out as the last work (commit `03f1fcf` merge, `78b45f7`, `3ef65c2`).

## 1. Scope

`ROUND3_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`'s S3-15 entry: "Firebase App Check provider wiring in client + rules
enforcement scaffold; enforcement enable = operator runbook; sideloaded-APK caveat = accepted."
Exit condition: "client wiring + rules scaffold source-reviewed; enable step is operator." No
compile/emulator promotion in this environment — `START_HERE.md`'s chain-state line explicitly
says "Do NOT promote it to fixed here."

## 2. Implementation

**`app/build.gradle`** — added two dependency lines inside the existing Firebase block:
- `implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-appcheck-playintegrity'` (all build types —
  Play Integrity is the real-device attestor used in release).
- `debugImplementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-appcheck-debug'` (debug builds only, so the
  debug-token provider — which mints a bypass token instead of a real attestation — can never end
  up in a release APK).

**`app/src/main/java/com/duoshield/app/DuoShieldApp.java`** — in `onCreate()`, before the existing
libsignal native-load block (so App Check is installed before any other Firebase SDK call in this
method, matching the SDK's own "install before first token request" requirement):
- `FirebaseAppCheck.getInstance(FirebaseApp.getInstance())`, then
  `installAppCheckProviderFactory(PlayIntegrityAppCheckProviderFactory.getInstance())`.
- If `BuildConfig.DEBUG`, additionally installs `DebugAppCheckProviderFactory.getInstance()`.
- Wrapped in try/catch that logs and continues (fail-open) — App Check is an attestation layer,
  not the app's only control; a provider-install failure on an unsupported device/Play-Services
  combo must not crash startup for that user.

**`firestore.rules`** — added an `appCheckVerified()` helper function
(`return request.app != null;`) at the top of the ruleset, with an in-rule comment explaining
exactly why it is not yet referenced by any `allow` clause (see BUG_TRACKER row for the full
reasoning — monitoring-first rollout, existing installs need the new APK first, and the emulator
test harness doesn't mint App Check tokens yet).

No other files touched. No existing guard removed or weakened — this is additive only.

## 3. Verification (protocol §4)

Commands run this session, output pasted (not remembered):

```
$ which java firebase gradle
which: no java in (...)
which: no firebase in (...)
which: no gradle in (...)
```
→ AND (Gradle compile) and RULES (firebase emulator) lanes are both confirmed unavailable in this
environment, matching every prior Round-3 session's finding. Source-review is the only lane that
can execute here, per the plan's own lane table.

```
$ grep -n "appcheck\|AppCheck" app/build.gradle
241:    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-appcheck-playintegrity'
242:    debugImplementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-appcheck-debug'

$ grep -n "AppCheck\|BuildConfig.DEBUG" app/src/main/java/com/duoshield/app/DuoShieldApp.java
23:import com.google.firebase.appcheck.FirebaseAppCheck;
24:import com.google.firebase.appcheck.debug.DebugAppCheckProviderFactory;
25:import com.google.firebase.appcheck.playintegrity.PlayIntegrityAppCheckProviderFactory;
... (install calls at :73-81)
```

```
$ python3 -c "s=open('firestore.rules').read(); print('open',s.count('{'),'close',s.count('}'))"
open 79 close 79
```
→ Balanced; no syntax damage to the ruleset from the inserted helper.

```
$ cd server && npm test
ℹ tests 230
ℹ pass 229
ℹ fail 1   (lib/identityVerify.test.js — pre-existing missing-native-module failure,
             documented since S3-05; server code was NOT touched this session, so this
             run only confirms no collateral breakage, not the fix itself)
```

No new automated tests were written this session: the change is a client dependency declaration +
provider install call + an unused rules helper, none of which are exercised by the `server/`
Node test suite (no server code changed) or by `firestore-tests/rules.test.js` (the helper is not
referenced by any rule yet, so there is nothing behavioral to assert — a test asserting
"`appCheckVerified()` returns true when `request.app != null`" would be a tautological wrapper
around the emulator's own `request.app` semantics, not a regression guard for anything this repo
controls, and the emulator to run it doesn't exist here anyway). The meaningful regression coverage
gap — "does enforcement actually block a request without a valid App Check token" — cannot be
written until enforcement is wired into an `allow` clause, which this session deliberately does not
do. That test is the right scope for the session that adds the `&& appCheckVerified()` clauses.

## 4. Disposition

`S10-N1`: **Partial** (was `Open`). Client provider wiring and rules scaffold are source-complete
and additive; verified this session. Not `Fixed`:
- Android compile unverified (no JDK/Gradle/SDK) → promotes via **S3-19b**.
- Rules helper unreferenced by any `allow` clause (deliberate, monitoring-first) — if/when a later
  session wires it in, that change's emulator verification routes via **S3-15b**.
- Enforcement enable (Firebase console) and the sideloaded-APK caveat are operator/accepted,
  per the plan — not code tasks.

## 5. Files changed

- `app/build.gradle`
- `app/src/main/java/com/duoshield/app/DuoShieldApp.java`
- `firestore.rules`

## 6. Commit

`9b58b3a402eb05d95f8704010c6b86eeb1099ec7` — "S3-15: App Check client provider wiring + rules
scaffold (S10-N1)".

## 7. Chain state

`NEXT SESSION` advances to **S3-16** (Android crypto storage — `S08-H5`/`S07-M1`, `S07-L2`,
`S07-L3`; lane AND, verify BLOCKED → S3-19b), per `ROUND3_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`'s ordering. S3-15b
and S3-19b remain open catch-up gates, unchanged — this session did not run them and does not claim
to have.
